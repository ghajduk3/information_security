In order to set up network(router), on the router we configure interfaces in /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml

network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    enp0s3: --- Which interface
      dhcp4: true
      dhcp-identifier: mac
    enp0s8:
      addresses: [10.0.0.1/24] --- Manually asign addresses to the interface enp0s8
    enp0s9:
      addresses: [172.16.0.1/24]


In order to apply changes --------- sudo netplan apply

Next, enable routing for IPv4 so that the isp will actually behave as a proper router: echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
