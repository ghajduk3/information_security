In order to set up network(router), on the router we configure interfaces in /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml

network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    enp0s3: --- Which interface
      dhcp4: true
      dhcp-identifier: mac
    enp0s8:
      addresses: [10.0.0.1/24] --- Manually asign addresses to the interface enp0s8
    enp0s9:
      addresses: [172.16.0.1/24]


In order to apply changes --------- sudo netplan apply

Next, enable routing for IPv4 so that the isp will actually behave as a proper router: echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

Finally, to route internet-bound traffic from client and server subnets, configure the isp to act as a network address translator (NAT): sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o enp0s3 -j MASQUERADE

---------------- SETTING UP REMOTE CLIENT ---------------------- 
In order to set up a client we should change the /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml :

network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    enp0s3:
      # assign the IP address
      addresses: [10.0.0.2/24]
      # set the default route through isp
      gateway4: 10.0.0.1
      # use Google's DNS
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8]

In order to apply changes ------ sudo netplan apply
